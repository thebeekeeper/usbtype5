Texas Instruments, Inc.


********************************************************************************
Welcome to the MSP-EXP430F5529LP LaunchPad!
********************************************************************************

In this package, you will find design files and software source codes that can
help get you started in developing your own project.

Two example software projects are located in the 'Software' folder:
 1. emulStorageKeyboard  | Out-of-Box Demo source code
 2. simpleUsbBackchannel | USB communication via Backchannel UART Example source code
 
In addition, TI-TXT images of these examples are located in 'Software > TXT Image Files'
These images are ready to be flashed onto your LaunchPad using a free MSP430 programming
interface, such as the MSP430Flasher.

Also available in the 'Hardware' folder are the complete board schematic and layout,
bill of material, and Gerber files.

Last but not least, you can find the Quickstart Guide in the 'Documentation' folder,
along with links to the MSP-EXP430F5529LP User's Guide, MSP430 USB Developers Package,
and MSP430Flasher.
